# VR-Education-Application
Interactive VR application built in Unreal Engine to teach electronic fundamentals (logic gates: AND, OR, NOR) to first-year engineering students. Designed as a scalable educational tool demonstrating how VR can enhance engagement, interactivity, and understanding of abstract electronic concepts.

# Project Overview
The VR Education Application is designed to provide an immersive learning experience for students to understand electronic logic gates. It simulates real-world circuits in a virtual environment, allowing users to interact with components, visualize logic outputs, and test circuits in real time. This project was developed as part of an educational initiative and tested with students to evaluate usability, engagement, and learning outcomes.

# Features
* Interactive VR environment with realistic logic gate simulations
* Supports multiple logic gates: AND, OR, NOT, NAND, NOR, XOR
* Visual feedback for circuit outputs in real time
* User-friendly interface for assembling and testing circuits
* VR-based interactions for hands-on learning
 
# Demo Video
Watch the application in action: [Youtube Demo](Tests/Demo.md) 

# Setup Guide
1. Clone or download the repository.
2. Open the project in Unreal Engine.
3. Build the project if using C++ source code.
4. Launch VR mode and use the controllers to interact with circuits.

> All required configuration files are included in `Config/`.
> Unreal will regenerate `Binaries/`, `Intermediate/`, and `DerivedDataCache/` automatically.

# Testing & Results
* Observations: improved understanding of logic gate behaviour in an interactive VR environment.
* Any known issues or limitations noted in `Documentation/X00152632_AlbinJacob_VRProject`.
